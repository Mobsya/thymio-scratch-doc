# thymio-scratch

The document describes simulations of the Thymio robot (www.thymio.org)
in Scratch. The LaTeX source is in directory en and it uses the files in
directory images.

The programs themselves and the costumes are also included, but it is
better to access them from my Thymio studio on the Scratch website at
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1023692.
